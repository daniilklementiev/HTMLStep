    <h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>
    <h2>Linear Equations</h2>
    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
    <p>ax+by=0</p>
    <p>
      where a and b are real numbers and x is a variable. This form is sometimes
      called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear
      equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may
      not be an x so donТt get too locked into always seeing an x there.
    </p>
    <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>
    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
    <p>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</p>
    <p>
      where <i>a, b, c</i> are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we
      don't know it yet). Also, a can't be 0.
    </p>
    <h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>
    <p>π(Pi) times the radius (r) squared:</p>
    <p>A = π × r<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>or, when you know the diameter (D):</p>
    <p>A = (π / 4) × D<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>or, when you know the circumference (C):</p>
    <p>A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 × π</p>
    <h2>Intersection</h2>
    <p>
      The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A ⋂ B, is the set of all
      objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,
    </p>
    <p>A ⋂ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}</p>
    <p>
      That is, <i>x</i> is an element of the intersection A ⋂ B if and only if
      <i>x</i> is both an element of A and an element of B.
